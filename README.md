## 📚 How to Use This Repository

1. **For Learning**: Start from challenge #1 and work your way up. Try solving each problem yourself before checking the solution.

2. **For Interview Prep**: Focus on challenges related to topics you're weak in. Study multiple approaches for each problem.

3. **For Practice**: Pick random challenges and implement them from scratch without looking at solutions.

4. **For Reference**: Use as a quick reference during interview preparation or when you need to recall a specific algorithm.
