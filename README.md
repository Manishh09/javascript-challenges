## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Manishh09/javascript-challenges.git
   cd javascript-challenges
   ```

2. **Explore challenges**
   - Browse through numbered folders (01-26)
   - Each folder contains solution files and comprehensive tests
   - Many challenges have `README.md` with detailed explanations
   - High-priority folders: currying, memoization, polyfills, debouncing, throttling

3. **Run the code**

   ```bash
   # Navigate to any challenge folder
   cd 01-find-duplicates
   
   # Run the solution
   node find-duplicates.js
   
   # Run comprehensive tests
   node tests.js
   ```

4. **Running Tests**
   Most challenges now include a `tests.js` file with:
   - Multiple test cases covering edge cases
   - Visual explanations with ASCII art
   - Performance comparisons
   - Real-world examples

   ```bash
   cd 25-debouncing
   node tests.js  # See debouncing in action with timers

## 📚 How to Use This Repository

1. **For Learning**: Start from challenge #1 and work your way up. Try solving each problem yourself before checking the solution.

2. **For Interview Prep**: Focus on challenges related to topics you're weak in. Study multiple approaches for each problem.

3. **For Practice**: Pick random challenges and implement them from scratch without looking at solutions.

4. **For Reference**: Use as a quick reference during interview preparation or when you need to recall a specific algorithm.
