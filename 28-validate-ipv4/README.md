# Problem Statement

Write a program to validate whether a given string is a valid IPv4 address.

- An IPv4 address consists of four octets separated by dots (.), where:
- The address must contain exactly four octets
- Each octet must be a number
- Each octet is a number between 1 and 255

The program should return true if the IP address is valid, otherwise false.
